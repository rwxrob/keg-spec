# KEG User

A **user** is anyone using a keg for any reason. This term is preferred over "consumer" or even "reader" since KEG knowledge content includes data and graphics even though most users are simply readers and researchers.

Users control their own cached copies, their update intervals, and personal, localized search preferences.
