# Optionally using bold for linking to terms

* A **content creator** MAY use bold (`**term**`) for terminology.
* A **content creator** SHOULD create node with title matching case-insensitive term.
* A **keg app** MAY provide automatic hyperlinking of bold terms to matching nodes.

KEG content creators are strongly encouraged to use the simple double-star (`**`) KEGML `bold` for content that heavily depends on definitions of specific terms. Reserving use of `bold` greatly improves the efficiency of writing technical content that would otherwise require a full link to be written out. This approach leverages the best advantages of hypertext while avoiding the disadvantages of more complicated linking syntax and potentially broken external links.
