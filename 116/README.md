# KEG apps don't have to implement the whole spec

The idea of KEG is that content and tooling that are *easy* to create and manage. The spec is designed to be simple enough that most any **content creator** with a little coding experience and access to some common markdown tools could create a **KEG app** of their own. Such apps might not ever implement the whole **specification** but might seed ideas for further development that may lead to fully compliant apps eventually.

This challenge is to help content creators know when their keg is **out of spec** because other tools being used might not be able to process that user's keg. But it is perfectly acceptable and expected that a great number of kegs will be created that do not comply, until and when it because a priority to publish and exchange them with others.
