# Universal Resource Locator (URL)

URLs occur in the following places within a keg directory:

1. Footnote usually as a citation
1. Bulleted or numbered list
1. Within **follow** and **avoid** files

The schema for a URL draws heavily from Git URL, which is a superset of those allowed for the Web.
