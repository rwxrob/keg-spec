# Content creator

A KEG **content creator** creates one or more kegs and shares them over KEG, the [Knowledge Exchange Grid](/36). The term "creator" is preferred over "writer" since equal importance is given to data, figures, and graphics creators. Indeed, data keg creators are among the most valuable and important in the KEG community and enable KEG to be used as a world-wide, structured [database](/58).
