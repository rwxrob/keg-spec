# KEGMLX Node Include Links Replaced

Each **node include link** within an **include block** will be injected into the node file that includes it at the exact location of the **include link**. The **title heading** will have its **hashtag** incremented by one to indicate the position within the including document (which itself, might have already had its title heading incremented by being included into something else).

This is the mind-blowing part of KEG, its very raison d'Ãªtre. It is where the organically created and loosely organized content of a **knowledge exchange graph** takes form as powerful compositions ready these thoughts and ideas for expression, exchange, and publication. This is the reason some of the greatest minds in the world --- and most prolific authors --- follow a mind-map/knowledge graph approach to their creative process.
