# Acronyms are terms with beacons and nodes

* An acronym SHOULD be considered a **term**.
* Any first occurrence of a term SHOULD be made a **beacon**.
* An acronym **node** MUST contain a **node link** to full term.

Acronyms are extremely prevalent and problematic in any modern technical, academic, and business writing --- especially since so many of them can mean different things. The KEG specification, therefore, strongly recommends that each be considered a term with its own node explaining its meaning and linking to the expanded version of itself.

However, this practice is not required since many KEG **content creators** produce creative works and would find this distracting from their prose.
