# KEG is For Writers

Unlike the modern Web, KEG caters primarily to the needs of *writers* who
wish to control not only their own authenticated content, but also their
view of those they specifically wish to follow, and --- most importantly
--- their *own* search parameters based on predictable semantic content
organization. This is far different from the modern Web where no one can
know for sure who wrote what and "SEO" is dictated by those with the
most money and power to promote their own agenda. KEG promotes informed
written dialog and debate (not advertising, trolling, and violent
disagreement).

KEGML, the main syntax of knowledge source on KEG, is a simplified
version of Pandoc Markdown. Most can learn it over a single cup of
coffee. No tools other than a means of writing and storage are required.
Even paper and pencil fulfill this need. KEG content creation is,
therefore, highly compatible with most note-taking techniques ---
especially the Zettelkasten method. Need complicated Math notation? The
international MathJax standard is supported making KEG 100% accessible
to the blind community as well.
