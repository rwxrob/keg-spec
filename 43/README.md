# Graph data structure

A **graph data structure** is a way to organize relationships such that a **node** represents the vertex at which other lines, links, or edges meet.

There are different types of graphs including a **rooted node tree** which takes the form of a top-down hierarchy commonly found in a document table of contents or file directory structure.

The Web and social media networks are non-hierarchical "weighted graphs" where the more links to a given node create a greater weight. This is how the basic idea behind search engine optimization, for example.

Graphs are also used when considering all kegs that a keg user follows. Each keg **follow** file can be combined with recommendations from others for a specific keg. This creates a greater weight to a particular node facilitating priority searches.
