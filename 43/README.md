# Graph data structure

A **graph data structure** is a way to organize relationships such that a **graph node** represents the vertex at which other lines, links, or edges meet.

There are different types of graphs including a **rooted node tree** which takes the form of a top-down hierarchy commonly found in a document table of contents or file directory structure. The Web and social media networks are non-hierarchical **weighted graphs** where the more links to a given node create a greater weight. This is how the basic idea behind search engine optimization, for example. It is also used when considering all kegs that a keg user follows. Each keg **FOLLOWS** file can be combined and the higher the number of follows for a specific keg, the greater the interlinking weight (which is but one consideration when creating KEG **queries**).
