# KEG Markup Language (KEGML)

> Less is more.

KEGML is a deliberately limited version of GitHub Flavored Markdown specifically for semantic interoperability on KEG. It is suitable for conversion into most rich publications formats including academic papers, books, novels, articles, and blog posts and inspired by the limitations of blogging and writer-centric platforms like the original Web and modern services like Medium (where you can ironically pay for the privilege of forcing those limitations on yourself today).

KEGML aims to be a first-class publishing format enabling creation of traditional, printed books and ePubs while maintaining compatibility with common source management services like GitHub and GitLab.

KEGML borrows heavily from the highly-successful constraints and habits of Niklas Luhman's Zettelkasten[^50.2] method. These constraints force writers to produce simpler, digestible content with an organization that is easier on everyone, no matter the method of final publication. Modular content nodes are easily moved and included into any composition.
