# Differences between KEG and PKG?

The word "exchange" is the difference. A **keg** *is* a PKG, but a PKG isn't the KEG. KEG pushes the idea of knowledge management beyond "personal" and makes it public. Perhaps that's what the P should stand for instead in PKG so that people could say "personal knowledge graph" or "public knowledge graph".
