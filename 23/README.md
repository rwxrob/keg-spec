# HTML5 i Element

> The i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.[^23.1]

The HTML5 `i` element has not meant *italic* for some time. In KEGML, therefore, wrapping a span in a single star (`*`) creates an `inflect` element instead to remind the reader to "alternate voice or mood" when reading it.
