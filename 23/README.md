# HTML5 i Element

The **i** element has not meant *italic* for some time. This is why the PEGN element for it is `Inflect` to match its HTML5 root definition and usage to indicate an "alernate voice or mood".

> The i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts.
