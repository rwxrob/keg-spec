# Refactoring knowledge

In software development the concept of "refactoring" is reorganizing code that makes sense to be together where it might not have been there in the first place. Without refactoring, software projects become unwieldy, full of technical debt that crystallizes into brittle code bases that have to eventually be thrown out rather than improved upon.

Writers "refactor" all the time but call it "editing" instead. The process is largely identical. In fact, when using popular tools like Scrivener we see an almost one-for-one comparison to software development.

The reason for this commonality is pretty obvious. Humans like graph structures. And why wouldn't we, a graph structure is *exactly* how the neurons in our brains are organized and connected. We can leverage this knowledge to get the most performance out of our [second brain](../49) as well.

Say a technical author has been letting their first and second brains go organically wild during their creative writing process. They let those tangent and rabbit holes become productive opportunities to explore content they might now have included had then been more rigid about their process. They riff on thoughts and knowledge like a jazz musician at the local pub on a random Thursday night (when the drinks are cheaper). But what happens when they stop and look back and realize that some of that amazing stuff has no place in this specific KEG. No worries. It's time to refactor.

Refactoring *anything* using a rooted node graph structure is like pruning and grafting a tree branch, literally. You sever the branch at its connection point, taking everything under it with it, and splice it into another, or plant it as a new tree. There's a reason that we think of all file systems as rooted node trees. Humans can really understand them. This is *exactly* what KEG allows.

::: BTW

Gopher already attempted to organize knowledge over the Internet using this method, and it came pretty close to succeeding. Hence, the resurgence of Gopher use in the face of a horrible Web for knowledge exchange. But Gopher has its own limitations that KEG addresses directly, the most obvious being the application of lessons successfully learned from Luhman's Zettelkasten approach.
