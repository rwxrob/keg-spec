# User keg

A **user keg** is unlike usual kegs because it is the primary keg maintained by a [**keg user**](/21) as a KEG community member. A user keg is distinct from other kegs in two important ways:

1. User kegs provide user identity and authentication
2. User kegs emphasis entries in **follow list** and **avoid list**.

User kegs contain additional information in the keg file that identifies the user in ways the users chooses. This information is kept in the `user` section of the `keg` file.

Users often include their **custom data** schemas in their **user keg** since it is authoritative and gets their priority attention.

A typical user follows thousands of kegs. Many of these are other user kegs. The combined database of kegs to follow and avoid produces a substantial list of trusted (and untrusted) **content creators**. This enables KEG community members to control their own content exposure, searches, and recommendations.

The authenticated, peer-2-peer trust provided by millions of participating KEG users gives Knowledge Exchange Grid a significant advantage over the Web at any point during its evolution.
