# Beacon span

* A **paragraph** or **list item** MAY include a **beacon span** (aka "beacon").
* A beacon starts with two stars (`**`) followed by a **rune** that is not **white space**.
* A beacon ends with two stars (`**`) preceded by a rune that is not white space.
* A beacon MUST be used to draw attention with no alteration of voice or mood.
* A beacon matches the definition of the HTML5 `b` element (which is not "bold").

> The b element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes, without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.[^27.1]

The HTML5 specification explains that the `b` element has nothing to do "boldness" or "strong emphasis." In fact, "b" is kept because of its historical usage for exactly those reasons. KEGML uses the name **beacon** instead, which is "an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a specific location"[^27.2]
