# Difference between follow/avoid in user and other kegs

* Any **keg** MAY contain a **follow list** and **avoid list**.
* A **user keg** SHOULD contain more entries in both lists.

A **user keg** usually contains more entries since it is the primary way a KEG community member indicates whom they follow and suggest others avoid in general. A **user keg** **follow list** usually includes everything produced by that user as well, a way of informing their followers of all the kegs that they have created or maintain.
