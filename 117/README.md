# No tags in content nodes

Meta data within the main content prevents searches of that content to produce results that have useful surrounding context. A simple grep, for example, turns up the line with all the tags instead of the line within a paragraph that uses the tag or term.

Tags are, however, very useful in meta matter files where they can be used when publishing to other services like Twitter, Mastodon, YouTube and the like. Tags can also be manipulated by dishonest people to cause content to seem to be related to things that don't even involve the term at all.
