# Simplified YAML structured data

* All structured data on main KEG components MUST be YAML
* YAML files used by KEG MUST use four-letter suffix (`.yaml`)

YAML has become the world-wide standard for human-friendly structured data. Any communication or configuration between any **keg app** MUST use simplified YAML (which includes JSON). This limitation does not apply to files within any **node** where any forms of structured data is permitted.
