# One beacon per term, per node

* The first occurrence of a **term** in a **node** SHOULD be made a **beacon**.
* Only the first occurrence of a **term** SHOULD be made a beacon.

Writers have long followed the practice of bringing attention to a term only the first time it is mentioned to avoid distracting stylistic changes throughout the work. A KEG **content creator** is therefore encouraged to practice the same by marking first occurrences with a **beacon** to draw attention to them only that first time. Most readers should welcome and expect this, but it may be worth noting this practice early in the primary **content path**.
