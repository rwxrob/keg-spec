# Single line paragraphs promote better paragraph content

Writing paragraphs as a single continuous line makes people write better paragraphs. Perhaps it is the slight annoyance particularly when editing from a terminal editor without a mouse. Whatever the reason such paragraphs sentences in such paragraphs tend to focus on the topic contained in the topic sentence better than paragraphs containing soft wrapping.

Continuous line paragraphs are also much easier to organize because each paragraph is just a single line to cut and paste into a new order. This is particularly true in terminal editors where the writer is now free to take full advantage of stretching the editor across the entire terminal width. While it may be less optimal to read content stretched out to such widths, it makes editing and reorganizing that content much easier for the writer, no matter the editor chosen.
