# KEGMLX Reference Blocks Anywhere

The KEGML **reference block** section is no longer required to be at bottom in a
KEGMLX document (just before the **tags block**).

::: Note

Normally, this is not something content creators would ever think about and it was very closely omitted from this specification completely since it isn't directly relevant to content creation and exchange. But, it is critical for those creating tools to understand how it plays in the creation of published KEG content in other formats.
