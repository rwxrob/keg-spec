# KEGML URLs must only appear in lists and footnotes

* A **URL** MUST ONLY exist within **footnote** or **list item**.
* A **keg app** MUST warn if URL use (`://`) is detected outside of specification.

KEGML is strict with regard to clean, consumable content. Therefore, URLs of any kind are prohibited from being included within any KEGML content *except* within a *list item* or  **footnote**. This is to prevent URLs from destroying the readability of the source text. Even contained, many Web URLs should still be shortened.

::: Comment

Unfortunately, there is no curing the diseased state of modern Web URLs. Containing them, however, prevents them from infecting most KEG content.
