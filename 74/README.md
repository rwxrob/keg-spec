# URL must only appear in footnote, list item, or simple block

* A **URL** MUST ONLY be in **footnote** or **list item** or **URL block**.
* A **keg app** MUST warn if URL use (`://`) is detected **out of spec**.

KEG is strict with regard to clean, consumable **content**. Therefore, URLs of any kind are prohibited from KEGML content *except* within a footnote (usually with a **citation**) or in a list item. This is to prevent URLs from ruining source readability as they have done for the Web[^74.1].

[^74.1]: Unfortunately, there is no curing the diseased state of modern Web URLs. Containing them effectively, however, prevents them from infecting KEG content.
