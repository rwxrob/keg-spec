# Justifying content redundancy

The nature of indexes requires that for every index there be some redundancy in what is being indexed. Depending on the index this can double a keg's size. Since the content is text, however, this cost in storage is easily worth the benefit to search time when applied across potentially thousands of followed keg caches.

Even on the largest of kegs, creating an index takes only a few seconds --- at most --- on most modern computers and is done quietly in the background by a **keg bot** while the content creator focused on creating the content.

Followers can opt to exclude one or more indexes like anything else they wish to ignore from a followed keg by specifying what to ignore or include in their **follow file**.
