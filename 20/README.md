# Terms "name" vs "title"

A **name** (as in "user name", "file name", "node name") MUST refer to the specific thing containing the content (ex: `some-thing`, `README.md`, `world.png`). Names are used in **links**. A name SHOULD be human-friendly, but it is not required (ex: `20221109T214722`).

A **title** MUST refer to the natural language used to give content a readable title (ex: "The KEG Specification", "What is the meaning of life?").
