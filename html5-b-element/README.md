# HTML5 b Element

The **b** element still means "bold" under HTML5, since such content is bolder than everything else to draw attention to itself. Bold is the proper span to use when isolating and drawing attention to terminology when used for the first time (where **i** would be wrong because no voice inflection is necessarily intended).

> The b element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede.
