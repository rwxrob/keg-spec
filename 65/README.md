# Universal Resource Locators (URL)

* A **URL** MUST comply with RFC 2986.

KEGML documents may contain output URLs to other resources, wherever they may be. All URLs are identified by the presence of `://` in what would otherwise qualify as a KEGML **field**.

* [*Only in lists and footnotes](/74)
