# AP style preferred

All KEG content SHOULD comply with AP style guidelines by default. This style can be communicated in the KEG property `style` within the `KEG.yaml` file, which only has two possible values at the moment:

* `ap`
* `custom`

This implies the following:

* Node titles SHOULD be "sentence case" (which is easier to read and write)
* KEG titles SHOULD be in "title case" (which is suitable for book publishing)

These guidelines equally apply to bibliographic references in [footnotes] as well.
