# KEG Markup Language (KEGML)

KEGML is a simplified (and deliberately limited) version of Pandoc
Markdown specifically for use in [KEG nodes](/keg-node). It is suitable
for conversion into most rich publications formats including academic
papers, books, novels, articles, and blog posts and inspired by the
limitations of blogging and writer-centric platforms like
the original Web and modern services like Medium (where you can
ironically pay for the privilege of forcing those limitations on
yourself today).

KEGML aims to be a first-class publishing format enabling creation of
traditional, printed books and ePubs while maintaining compatibility with
common source management services like GitHub and GitLab.

KEGML borrows heavily from the highly-successful constraints and habits
of Niklas Luhman's Zettelkasten method. These constraints force writers
to produce simpler, digestible content with an organization that is
easier on everyone, no matter the method of final publication. Modular
content nodes are easily moved and included into any composition.
