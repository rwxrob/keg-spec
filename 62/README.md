# Bold used for terminology

In [KEGML](/50) bold is primarily used to "represent a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood, such as key words in a document abstract, product names in a review, actionable words in interactive text-driven software, or an article lede." ([HTML5 b Element](/27)) As such it can be reliably used to create terminology indexes in most keg content.


While it is not strictly specified, it is strongly recommended that the use of bold in [KEGML] follow the definition and usage outlined in [HTML5] meaning primarily for terminology and "actionable words in an interactive text" (which is exactly what KEGs are). This strict use of the bold element makes short work of creating indexes of terminology to be used throughout the pod and the *domain-specific language* produced by such pods.

Incorrect use of bold (and inflect) are therefore something tool creators should consider when helping content creators know when they have misused those specific markup elements.
