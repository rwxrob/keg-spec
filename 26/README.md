# Independent nodes

* An **independent node** MUST NOT have any other nodes that include it.
* An independent node MUST NOT be the target of **node links**.
* An independent node MUST be included in the `dex` **keg index file**.

An independent node is one on which no other nodes depend. Content creators can freely move such a node from one keg to any other. It is common during the content creation process to create several independent nodes during creative **mind mapping** sessions and then later to identify the relationships and organize the nodes into larger compositions. This technique is at the core of Luhmann's Zettelkasten method[^26].
