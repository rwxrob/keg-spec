# "Front matter" was never actually front matter

The term **front matter** has a very specific meaning to the writing and publishing world. It is the content at the beginning of the content before the actual content. There is **end matter** as well that comes after the main **body** of content.

Those who decided to add "front matter" to Markdown (all those years ago) did so without considering that eventually Markdown would become a main syntax for writing actual printed publications as well. They meant no harm, but today this has caused some confusion.

Front matter in Markdown has come to mean that bit of YAML, JSON, or TOML that is allowed at the very top of a Markdown document. GitHub still tries to render this structured data as nested tables in HTML, which (as harsh as it sounds) is hideous.
