# Publication, distribution, and exchange strategies

Every keg is different in purpose, content, and therefore size. Each has its own requirements for distribution and exchange. Some will contain very large data sets, others just simple text files, others perhaps high-resolution images, or even compressed video files.

While there is no limitation on what can be contained in a keg, content creators and application developers should heaving weigh any decision to increase the overall size of the aggregate content in a single keg directory. Depending on the method of hosting and transport, large files might not even be allowed by the provider. Nevertheless, such decisions are left to the KEG community to decide.
