# Determining title of included content

Include titles MUST contain at least one letter and SHOULD be descriptive (since they serve as simple links from GitHub when browsing `README.md` files).

Every **node** has a **title**. Every **include** also has a title.

Tools MUST keep the include title (discarding the node title).

All titles MUST be discarded if the include title begins with a exclamation point (`!`).
