# Heavily inspired by "mind mapping" applications and "zettelkasten"

The idea to organize knowledge content into a "mind map" graph tree structure where topics are broken down into content nodes, is not new or unique. It's simply the most sensible solution to the problem of creative, organic content creation.

KEG borrows heavily from the proven ideas of "mind mapping" applications[^101.1] where graphic user interfaces provide a creative and effective way to visualize the creative process of capturing knowledge and imagine as easily as possible. These tools focus on getting out of the way so that the thoughts naturally flow organically from one idea to the next, interconnected in different ways.

Niklas Luhmann's "zettelkasten" method[^101.2] divides knowledge content into slips of paper with "one best idea" that can then be connected and composed into other content modularly.
