# Knowledge Exchange Graph (KEG) Specification

The *Knowledge Exchange Graph* is a secure, performant, grassroots,
decentralized, transport-agnostic, universal graph network of modular,
semantic, knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally
searched by those who create and maintain them. The KEG community shares
their recommendations to produce a self-governing knowledge network
built on authenticated, distributed trust.
