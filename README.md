# Knowledge Exchange Graph (KEG) Specification 2023-01

*State of this specification is current a working draft but readers can follow development by watching the [`keg` info file](keg) or [`dex` node index file](dex) for changes. (This repo is also the first "keg".)*

**Knowledge Exchange Grid/Graph** is a secure, performant, grassroots, decentralized, transport-agnostic, universal graph network of modular, semantic, knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally searched by those who create and maintain them. The KEG community shares their recommendations to produce a self-governing knowledge network built on authenticated, distributed trust.
