# Knowledge Exchange Graph (KEG) Specification 2023-01

State of this specification is currently a working draft but readers can follow development by watching the `keg` or `dex` files for changes. (This repo is also the first "keg".) Feedback and suggests are welcome as issues.

----

The Knowledge Exchange Graph (or Grid) is a secure, performant, grassroots, decentralized, transport-agnostic, universal graph network of modular, semantic, knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally searched by those who create and maintain them. The KEG community shares their recommendations to produce a self-governing knowledge network built on authenticated, distributed trust.
