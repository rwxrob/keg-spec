KEG provides highly efficient knowledge management and exchange for
anyone who creates written content --- especially those who have grown
frustrated by what the Web has become. The easier it becomes for
experienced people to share their knowledge the more likely they are to
become "willing and able to write about it."

More formally, the *Knowledge Exchange Graph* network is a secure,
performant, grassroots, progressively enhanced, decentralized,
transport-agnostic, universal graph network consisting of modular,
semantic, knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally
searched by those who create and maintain them in real time, and others
within their personal/professional learning networks who follow and
share their own along with recommendations for other KEG creators
to follow producing a self-governing knowledge trust where quality
content is promoted and abusive content is given no oxygen to flame.
