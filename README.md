# Knowledge Exchange Graph (KEG) Specification

*State of this specification is current a working draft (see
[KEG.yaml]).*

The *Knowledge Exchange Graph* is a secure, performant, grassroots, decentralized, transport-agnostic, universal graph network of modular, semantic, knowledge nodes that are exchanged, cached, and locally searched by those who create and maintain them. The KEG community shares their recommendations to produce a self-governing knowledge network built on authenticated, distributed trust.
