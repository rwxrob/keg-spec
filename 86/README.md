# Only one heading per node README.md file

KEG addresses the need for multi-level headings at a higher level, by forcing the knowledge into a graph data structure. This allows **keg apps** to come up with their own methods of aggregating, outlining, and linking to the content depending on the tool and final target output.

Moreover, KEGMLX does not limit headings to seven levels overcoming the persistent Web problem of stuffing deeply nested sectional content (such as the HTML5 specification) into "ordered lists" that have a redundant number on them that never matches the actual number of the ordered list.

Some on the Web actually use multiple level one headings because there has never been any enforcement of any semantic document organization ever on the Web.
