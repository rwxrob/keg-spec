# Only one heading per node README.md file

KEG addresses the need for multi-level headings at a higher level, by forcing the knowledge into a graph data structure. This allows **keg apps** to come up with their own methods of aggregating, outlining, and linking to the content depending on the tool and final target output.

Moreover, KEGMLX does not limit headings to seven levels overcoming the persistent Web problem of stuffing deeply nested sectional content (such as the HTML5 specification) into "ordered lists" that have a redundant number on them that never matches the actual number of the ordered list.

Some on the Web actually use multiple level one headings because there has never been any enforcement of any semantic document organization ever on the Web.

This idea about knowledge content organization is not new or unique. In fact, it borrows heavily from "mind map" applications and designs originating from the proven Zettelkasten principle of "one best idea" that can then be composed into other content modularly, not unlike good software design. It's the simplest and most sensible solution to the problem of organic content creation.
