# Smart punctuation is not specified

* This **specification** MUST NOT specify handing of smart punctuation.
* A **keg app** MAY detect and render smart punctuation depending on target language.

Given the complexities of punctuation based on the target language and the recommended use of simple [primes instead of quotes](../103) it seems best to let smart punctuation be left in the hands of keg app developers.
