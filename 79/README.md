# Lede span

* A lede is a **rune** span wrapped in triple stars (`***`)[^79] with non-ws where expected.
* A lede MUST be the first span of a **paragraph span**.
* A lede MAY be the only span in a paragraph span.
* An **include link** MAY specify lede with the `L` **query code**.

A lede (pronounced like "lead story") draws attention to the beginning of written content. This could be an entire summary paragraph at the beginning of a formal paper, or just one sentence leading into the rest of a paragraph where a full **heading** would be too much.

[^79]: In Markdown conversion to HTML this creates "strong emphasis".
