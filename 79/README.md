# Lede

* A KEGML *lede* is plain text wrapped in triple stars with non-ws where expected.

A *lede* (pronounced like "lead story") draws attention to the beginning of written content. This could be an entire summary paragraph at the beginning of a formal paper, or just one sentence leading into the rest of a paragraph where a full **heading** would be too much.
