# Div identifiers

KEGML **div identifiers** are one of the more power aspects of KEGML (and Pandoc originally). They allow the categorization of subtexts through a POD. This can create a secondary, narrative voice accompanying formal documentation; or it can be used to produce a word of warning about common pitfalls; or it address complete "rabbit hole" content that has nothing but the most minimal association with the main node content.

::: Tip

While it is not required by the specification, it is almost always preferable to keep the word associated with a div something that stands out on its own from the rest of the source content.
