The modern Web has all but obliterated the original goals of those who invented it at CERN. It has become a vehicle for trolling, advertising, disinformation, hate-mongering, and bloated, applications delivery. Gone are the notions of "page" or "document" when nothing on the Web could ever be published in any book (beginning with hyperlinking itself).

While it is true that the world needs a safe and effective means of application delivery over the Web, and that zero-opportunity-cost personal broadcasting has created undeniable positive change in the world --- promoting the voices of individuals --- the disastrous consequences of letting content creators and gatekeepers control how, what, and when content is consumed has done irreparable harm to the base usefulness of the Web as a place for open writing and dialog. Content consumption and search optimization --- once controlled by the readers without interference --- has been overtaken by those producing and pushing that content with their own profit-seeking and other agendas.

The KEG community seeks to build a better, impartial, and amoral communication network where individual sovereignty is given the highest priority, where free-speech is indeed revered, where we use as much of the existing Internet infrastructure as possible, but are not limited by it.

KEG users need not fear their content being cut off from them, or being forced to consume content they don't wish to see. KEG users can optionally follow others creating local cached copies of their content available even when the network is inaccessible. KEG users can also optionally provide a list of those they follow (and avoid) enabling rings of social trust to police KEG content without any heavy-handed moderation needed by any single entity.

In fact, it's impossible to censor content on KEG since KEG does not depend any specific technology at all. Carrying a KEG collection on a USB stick to another is a perfectly viable form of KEG exchange --- by design. The secret *is* the simplicity.

KEG will likely be received with incredulity and skepticism by those whose profit centers and dogmas are disrupted by its adoption, but we are committed to proving that a better, world-wide knowledge network --- one that can never be censored or stopped --- is possible, even if we are the only ones who use it.
