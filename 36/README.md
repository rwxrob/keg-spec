# Referring to "keg" vs "KEG"

Using the colloquial, lowercase word **keg** implies a single instance of a **knowledge exchange graph**, as in "I need to make a keg for that book content eventually."

Using the formal, uppercase KEG implies the larger scope of the KEG project and community, as in "this KEG meetup"; or "the KEG specification."

Since kegs are mostly distributed peer-to-peer, there is no equivalent of "the Web" for KEG. The closest thing would be referring to a specific service (such as keg.pub), as in, "Is your keg on keg.pub yet?"
