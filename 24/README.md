# Include link

A KEGML **include link** (or just "include") is an inline Markdown link that doubles as a marker for the location to include the target **node** or **file**. Includes allows content that has not yet been **expanded** to resolve properly for the user who can simply click on the links to get to that contact rather than reading it at that spot as they would after KEGMLX expansion.

Includes are usually grouped together into an **includes** list.

```md
* [Determining title of included content](/38)
* [Node include link](/0)
* [File include link](/0)
* [List include link](/0)
```

The **link text** of an **include link** usually serves as the **heading** when **expanded** into KEGMLX. A special prefix in the **link text** indicates what to do differently with the heading and how to include the **link target** content.

* [Determining title of included content](/38)
* [Node include link](/0)
* [File include link](/0)
* [List include link](/0)
