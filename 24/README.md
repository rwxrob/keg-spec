# Include link

A KEGML **include link** (or just "include") is an inline Markdown link that doubles as a marker for the location to include the target **node** or **file**.

Includes are usually grouped together into an **include list**.

The **link text** of an **include link** usually serves as the **heading** when **expanded** into KEGMLX. Prefixes to **link text** signal the omission of a heading entirely and the method of inclusion depending on whether the target is a **node** or **file**.
