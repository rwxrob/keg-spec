  state:
    description:
      Overall state of the KEG content. This allows content not ready
      for consumption or publication to be identified as such easily.
      'draft' means under active development. 'alpha' means released for
      consideration to isolated group of consumers for testing, but not
      ready. 'beta' means released widely for all consumers for final
      testing before release. 'working' means that portions are in
      'draft' state while most of it is also still being used. 'living'
      (default) means ready for consumption but regularly changing.
      'dynamic' is same as 'living' but content is changing at a much
      higher rate than most, useful for KEGs with high concentration of
      dynamic nodes. 'final' is for highly static content that very
      rarely changes, and if it did would likely result in another KEG
      rather than changes to this one.
