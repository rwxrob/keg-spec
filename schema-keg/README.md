# KEG Schema

The KEG schema (contained in `KEG.yaml`) promises 100% backward
compatibility forever (but does allow for deprecation). It is,
therefore, unnecessary to specify a specific version of KEG itself. Any
place that text content can be stored or distributed the existence of a
`KEG.yaml` file identifies a root KEG directory. This schema is also the
basis of the [Keg User Schema](/schema-user).

* [YAML Schema](DATA.yaml)
* [JSON Schema (from YAML)](DATA.json)
