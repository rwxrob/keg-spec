# KEG Domain Model

KEG primarily refers to the unit of content organization and exchange
over the "KEG net". This is roughly equivalent to a Web "site" as the
term was used historically to refer to a collection of "pages" or
"documents" (which few use today).

"Here's my KEG with that content in it" is something one could say
handing over a URL pointing to a KEG or a USB drive with the KEG stored
on it. The main point of KEG is the encapsulation of primarily written
content organized in a simple, predictable way to promote standardized
creation, management, and sharing.
