# Beautiful simplicity of Luhmann's identifiers

Luhmann understood the beauty of simplicity, partly because of constraints placed on him, and partly because of constraints he placed on himself. One of those constraints was drop-dead simple to remember identifiers for each atomic unit of knowledge content (which he called a "zettel").

Luhmann used simple numbers and letters and selected each identifier based on the practicality of where it would be in his wooden boxes to find. If he found himself pulling it out of the same box as another zettel he'd make the number a variation of that one, not unlike the Dewey-decimal system, but with categories of his own invention.

Databases have been using simple incrementing integers for unique identifiers for several decades. Yet for some reason we have allowed the Web to not stick with this idea about what it means to be a unique identifier even though the creator of the Web [called it out in the 90s](../2).
