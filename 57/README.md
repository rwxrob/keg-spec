# KEGML link differences from Markdown

* A KEGML **link** MUST NOT link to content outside of its keg.
* Markdown angle-bracketed links MUST NOT be supported in KEGML.

Web URLs (or any other network protocol URLs) are just text in URL form.

* [Omit reference links](/51)
* [URLs must only appear in lists and footnotes](/74)
