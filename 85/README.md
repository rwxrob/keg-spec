# Contextual semantic difference for same KEGML markup syntax

In some isolated cases the same KEGML markup syntax will produce different semantic and stylistic nodes when parsed. For example, single stars (`*`) wrapping anything in a **paragraph** or **list item** indicate **inflect** elements. But the same syntax has only **italic** meaning when it occurs within a **footnote**.
