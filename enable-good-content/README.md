# Enable Good Content

> "The level of technical content quality is inversely proportional to the prolificness of the author. This is why it is so difficult and valuable to uncover those few who actually know what they are talking about — because they do it every day for hours a day — and who are willing and able to write about it." (TJ Halowaychuk)

KEG provides highly efficient knowledge management and exchange for anyone who creates written content --- especially those who have grown frustrated by what the Web has become. The easier it becomes for experienced people to share their knowledge the more likely they are to become "willing and able to write about it."
