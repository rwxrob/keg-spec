# Minimal User Information

The [User KEG](/schema-user) does contain uniquely identifying
information but is deliberately minimal so that the KEG community will
be encouraged to come up with their own [custom KEG
data](/custom-keg-data) for any given service (and encourage those
services to post authoritative schemas for that custom data).
