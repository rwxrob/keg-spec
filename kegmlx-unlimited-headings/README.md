# KEGMLX Unlimited Headings

Since expanded KEGML is meant to be the composition of all the nodes in a KEG each node must be added as a subheading of the one including it and therefore will have its heading bumped to a RECOMMENDED maximum of six.

However --- unlike Markdown and HTML --- KEGMLX is not limited to six
headings.

This allows for very deep nesting as needed by specification outlines, legal
documents, and academic papers.

::: Rant

Can you imagine **Luhman** limiting himself to six levels of nesting?

HTML has long been unnecessarily limited to six headings. This has unfortunately forced all kinds of craziness when representing content in outline form that requires many more layers of nesting than that. KEG throws off this limitation while remaining compatible (for the most part) with Markdown and HTML. For those who need deeper nesting, KEG tool creators are free and encouraged to provide as many heading levels as needed.
