# Cypherpunk Manifesto

> "Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to defend privacy, and since we can’t get privacy unless we all do, we’re going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use, worldwide. We don’t much care if you don’t approve of the software we write. We know that software can’t be destroyed and that a widely dispersed system can’t be shut down." (Eric Hughes, A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto)

The cypherpunks (most active in the 90s) have long understood the need for reliable encrypted communication and privacy, but they equally value content authenticity and attribution through cryptographic signing. This has been painfully absent from the modern Web. The KEG project directly addresses this by allowing any and all content to be optionally signed and encrypted.
