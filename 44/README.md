# KEG Node Naming

KEG node directory names MUST be human readable and creatable with nothing but an analog watch (ex: [isosec]). This keeps them simple to digest, remember, and manage.

::: Warning

Failing to comply with the above KEG node human-readable naming convention is a sure way to be added to use AVOID lists and dropped from KEG index services --- especially the dubious, unnecessary use of UUIDs generated by software for such naming.

::: Warning

Changing the directory name of a node effectively destroys it and creates another with the new name. Often creating a new revision to the original node is preferable and a link within the old node added to the new one so that readers will have the historical context for the updates and changes. Other times, simply adding an "update" paragraph to the existing keg is enough to allow the title to be changed to no longer match the directory name.
