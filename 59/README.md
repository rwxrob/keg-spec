# Zero node

* A **keg** MUST include a **node** with an id of 0 called a **zero node**.
* A **zero node** MUST must be used for links to content not yet created.
* A **zero node** MUST explain when content can be expected.
* A **zero node** MAY itemize planned content by title and priority.

The required **zero node** provides details to the content user as to when planned content is to be expected. This gives content creators something to link to rather than not linking at all. These links can then be easily found within the content later and updated to point to a **node** with an ID other than 0.
