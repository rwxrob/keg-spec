# KEG node 0

KEG node 0 is a special, reserved id to which links can refer when a node has not yet been created. This way a node 0 can be created to explain this situation to those who follow it so they don't get a broken link. When rendered this also provides a hook for renderers to identify allowing them to link to a more generic search of the web for the text of the link in question.
