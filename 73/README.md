# Numbered lists restricted to 1.

* A **numbered list item** MUST begin with `1.` followed by a single space.

Unlike most other forms of Markdown, KEGML requires **numbered lists** to begin the ASCII number one (`1`) followed by a period/dot (`.`) and a single space. This strict limitation does three things:

1. Discourages brittle references to specific list items
1. Allows rapid reordering of list items
1. Provides a syntax that is easy to learn and remember
1. Works everywhere, in any language
1. Facilitates fast parsing

Lists grow and are reorganized frequently. Referring to any specific list item by number is, therefore, a bad practice. Instead, content creators should refer to items on the list (when necessary) by description. Generally, however, it is never required to refer to the list at all since the items are usually a summation of content available elsewhere.
