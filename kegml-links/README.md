# KEGML Links

KEGML strictly defines different types of links and expressly blocks all transparent hyperlinking to external content. Links also have specific semantic meaning and practical use that KEG tools can leverage during content aggregation and conversion into other publishing formats.

Here's a representative sample of different KEGML link types:
* [Problems with Web Links](/problems-with-web-links)
* [Node Include Links](/kegml-link-node-include)
* [Node Reference Links](/kegml-link-node-ref)
* [File Include Links](/kegml-link-file-include)
* [Bibliographic Note Links](/kegml-link-note)
* [External Link List Block](/kegml-link-external)
