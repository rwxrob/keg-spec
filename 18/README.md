# Link

* A KEGML **link** MUST be one of **node link**, **file link**, or **include link**.
* A KEGML **footnote** MUST NOT be considered a link.

KEGML specifies Markdown-like links and expressly blocks all hypertext linking to external content. Links also have structural meaning for practical use that KEG tools can leverage during content aggregation, searching, and conversion into other publishing formats.
