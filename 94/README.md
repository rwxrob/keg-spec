# Citation

* A citation MAY appear within a **footnote**.
* A citation MAY take any form or style.
* A single **URL** is a form of a citation.
* A URL MUST only appear in a citation.

A citation appears within a footnote. Any style of citation is permitted since this depends entirely on the final form of publication for any given keg.

A single URL is a form of citation and the only acceptable method of including Web URLs in KEG **content**.
