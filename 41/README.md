# README.md

The **node** `README.md` file MUST be valid KEGML to be considered a node at all.

Invalid README.md files MUST disqualify that node from inclusion in any KEG.

KEG directories that contain invalid README.md files MUST be disqualified from inclusion in KEG index engines and should be automatically recommended for the AVOID list.

::: Note

History has proven that there is plenty of opportunity for people to put whatever they want on the Internet. KEG is different. Our standards for content creation and participation are higher so that we can all benefit.
