# Simple quotes preferred

* Content creators SHOULD use single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes ("primes").
* Actual quote runes SHOULD be reserved for rendering and publishing.

Although a **rune** can be any valid Unicode code point, use of simple single (`'`) and double (`"`) "primes" has long been the preference and should be used instead of their actual equivalents. This makes punctuated word in indexes much more compatible across the global KEG community.
